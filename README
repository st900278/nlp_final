This code is for nature language processing final.

There are two files which are the main code.

dataset_create is to increase word which is related to place, we use McGram as our basic phrases and we use liggle to extends more words.

ngram_parser is to create phrases which is related to place, we use the word we find in dataset_create, and compare with web-1t small ngram.


Notice: In this repository, we didn't include the web-1t small ngram dataset. If user want to run the code have to make a directory called "web1t-small", and there are three files in it. (3gm.small, 4gm.small, 5gm.small)


Website: There is a website which present the result, and it is written with flask. Just execute "python main.py", and it will work
